# notes-indexer

A search indexer for a bespoke notes application. See related:

- [notes-api](https://github.com/mrshanahan/notes-api) - API/data layer backing the notes application
- [notes-term](https://github.com/mrshanahan/notes-term) - Terminal GUI for interacting with the notes application

This is still a WIP, and largely a learning exercise. The goal is to create a fully customized search function from the bottom up, relying (hopefully entirely) on non-machine-learning-based methods.
